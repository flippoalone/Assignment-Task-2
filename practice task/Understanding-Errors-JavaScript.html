    <h1>1.What is an error in JavaScript?</h1>

    <p>An Error is an event that disrupts the normal flow of your program. It essentially means something went wrong that prevents the computer from executing the code successfully.</p>

    <h2>2.Difference between Syntax and Runtime Errors</h2>


    <h3>3.Identify a Logical Error</h3>

    <h4>4.Write a simple try...catch example</h4>


    <h5>Explain why errors are important</h5>

    <p>
        Protection: They stop a program from running with bad data, which could corrupt a database or crash a server.
        <br>

Debugging: The error message acts like a map. It tells you exactly what went wrong and where (which line number), helping you fix bugs faster.
<br>
User Experience: By catching errors, you can show users helpful messages (like "Server is busy, try again") instead of a blank white screen.
    </p>


    <script>

            // ERROR: Missing the closing parenthesis ')'
console.log("Hello World"); 

// Result: Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list

// The code looks fine, but 'myFunction' does not exist!
myFunction();

// Result: Uncaught ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined


//3.Identify a logical error

const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 20;

// LOGICAL ERROR:
// Division happens before addition because of Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
const average = num1 + num2 / 2; 

console.log("Average is: " + average);
// Output: Average is: 20  (Wait, that's wrong!)


//4.Write a simple try...catch example

try {
  
  // 1. Try to run this code
  console.log("Start of try block");
  
  // This variable doesn't exist, so it causes an error
  alert(missingVariable); 
  
  console.log("End of try block"); // This line is skipped!

} catch (error) {
  
  // 2. If an error happens, run this code instead
  console.log("An error occurred!");
  console.log("Error details: " + error.message);

}

console.log("The program continues running...");
